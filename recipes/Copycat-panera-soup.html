      <p>My husband loves Panera broccoli Cheddar soup but 
        it's so expensive now so we set out to create our perfect version at home.
        This is the recipe we came up with. Serve topped with cheese.</p>
        <ul>

            <li>Home cooks like the flexibility to customize, by adding garlic and using bread bowls</li>
