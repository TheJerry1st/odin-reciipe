    <p>As far as fall baking goes, there are other flavors that hog the limelight (we're looking at you, pumpkin spice!). 
      The humble persimmon is oft forgotten, except by those who already love its honey-like flavor and know that 
      it is only available to enjoy during a short season.</p>
